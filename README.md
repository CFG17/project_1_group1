Create a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each "question" you asked of your data, and under each heading, a short description of what you found and any relevant plots.

Goal:
Our goal of the project was to find the "secret sauce" to have a highly rated app on the Google Play Store. We analyzed the categories of apps, number of reviews, number of installations, and whether the fact that an app was updated recently has any impact on the rating of the app. We are analyzing the rating of the app because of the system of which apps are organized on the app store. Higher rated apps will inherently succeed more because of their higher visibility, thus creating a positive feedback loop. 


Hypothesis: 
The higher the number of installs, higher number of reviews, and apps that are updated more recently will each have a positive correlation with the rating of the app. 

Findings:

Number of Installs and Rating: 
Although the graph indicates a positive relationship between Installs and Ratings, the correlation coefficient between the two is .04, which indicates a weak relationship between the two. The prediction of a positive relationship is true, but it is not statistically significant. 


Number of Reviews and Rating:
Although the graph indicates a positive relationship between Installs and Ratings, the correlation coefficient between the two is .055, which indicates a weak relationship between the two. The prediction of a positive relationship is true, but it is not statistically significant. 

Number Installs and Reviews:
This section provided us with the most promise of a statistically significant relationship. Although the graph indicates a positive relationship between Installs and Reviews, the correlation coefficient between the two is .624, which although it is promising, it does not indicate a statistically significant relationship.

Last updated and Rating:
The data also indicates a positive relationship between these two. However, we could not include a regression line in this chart despite our best efforts. Due to the nature of date being a different measurement than something like a rating or number of reviews, it doesn't work to find the correlation between the two. Although the relationship is visibly positive, we could not find the number to specifically indicate their statistical relationship and significance. 

Hypothesis: 
We failed to prove with statistical significance that there is a positive relationship between rating and installs, rating and reviews, and last update and rating. Although each relationship was positive, like our prediction, there was not a direct enough of a correlation to prove statistical significance. 

Additionally, we were able to determine the category that would most likely produce the highest rating. Taking into account each categories mean, upper and lower quartile, and outliers. Books and Reference had the highest mean, as well as one of the highest quartile ranges, with relatively few outliers on the low side. This seems to provide the best option for guaranteeing a high rating.
